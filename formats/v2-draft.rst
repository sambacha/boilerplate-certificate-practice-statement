|    applicant, or that the applicant is authorized to request a  |   |
|    certificate for that domain name. The applicant submits to   |   |

|    of ownership or right to use of the domain name, [COMPANY    |   |
|    CA] issues the certificate and sends a notice to the         |   |

|    [Company] [Client] certificates are intended for certain     |   |
|    communications and transactions that require a minimum       |   |
|    verification of the identity. They can be distributed for    |   |
|    communications and transactions with a need to authenticate  |   |
|    the communicating parties and encrypt the exchanged          |   |
|    communications. The validity period is between one and three |   |
|    years. [Company] [Client] certificates are issued to natural |   |
|    persons (individuals) within their professional context.     |   |
|                                                                 |   |

|    A certificate request can be made by the following means:    |   |
|                                                                 |   |
|    The certificate applicant submits an application according   |   |
|    to a procedure provided by [Company]. Additional             |   |
|    documentation in support of the application may be required  |   |
|    so that [Company CA] can verify the identity of the          |   |
|    applicant. The applicant submits to [Company] such           |   |
|    additional documentation. Upon verification of identity,     |   |
|    [Company CA] issues the certificate and sends a notice to    |   |
|    the applicant. The applicant downloads and installs the      |   |
|    certificate to the applicant’s device. The applicant must    |   |
|    notify [Company CA] of any inaccuracy or defect in a         |   |
|    certificate promptly after receipt of the certificate or     |   |
|    earlier notice of changes to the information to be included  |   |
|    in the certificate.                                          |   |

|    **Electronic signature**: Electronic signature can only be   |   |
|    used for specific electronic transactions that support       |   |
|    electronic signing of electronic forms, electronic           |   |
|    documents, electronic mail etc. The signature certificate is |   |
|    only warranted to produce electronic signatures in the       |   |
|    context of applications that support digital certificates.   |   |
|    To describe the function of an electronic signature, the     |   |
|    term non-repudiation is often used. [Company] [Client]       |   |
|    certificates are appropriate for electronic signatures.      |   |
|                                                                 |   |
|    **Authentication (Users)**: User authentication certificates |   |
|    can be used for specific electronic authentication           |   |

|    online content, electronic mail etc. The Authentication      |   |
|    function of a digital certificate can be ascertained in any  |   |
|    transaction context with the purpose of authenticating the   |   |
|    end user subscriber to a digital certificate. To describe    |   |
|    the function of authentication, the term digital signature   |   |
|    is often used. [Company] [Client] certificates are           |   |
|    appropriate for user authentication.                         |   |
|                                                                 |   |
|    **Authentication (Devices)**: Device authentication          |   |
|    certificates can be used for specific electronic             |   |
|    authentication transactions that support the identifying of  |   |
|    web sites and other on line resources. The Authentication    |   |
|    function of a digital certificate can be ascertained in any  |   |
|    transaction context with the purpose of authenticating a     |   |
|    device that the subscriber seeks to secure through a digital |   |
|    certificate. To describe the function of authentication, the |   |
|    term digital signature is often used. [Company] [Server]     |   |
|    certificates are appropriate for user authentication.        |   |
|                                                                 |   |
|    **Confidentiality**: All certificate types can be used to    |   |
|    ensure the confidentiality of communications effected by     |   |
|    means of digital certificates. Confidentiality is required   |   |
|    to assure the confidentiality of business and personal       |   |
|    communications as well as for purposes of personal data      |   |
|    protection and privacy. All [Company] certificates are       |   |
|    appropriate for confidentiality.                             |   |
|                                                                 |   |
|    Any other use of a digital certificate is not supported by   |   |
|    this CPS. When using a digital certificate the functions of  |   |
|    electronic signature (non repudiation) and authentication    |   |
|    (digital signature) are permitted together with the same     |   |
|    certificate.                                                 |   |

[COMPANY] Certification Practice Statement
------------------------------------------

   The [COMPANY CA] ensures the availability of all services pertaining
   to the management of [COMPANY] certificates, including without
   limitation the issuing, revocation, status verification of a
   certificate, as they may become available or required in specific
   applications.

   Appropriate publication is necessary to ensure that relying parties
   obtain notice or knowledge of functions associated with the revoked
   and/or suspended certificates. Publication is manifested by including
   a revoked or suspended certificate in a certificate revocation list
   that is published in an online directory.

   The domain of responsibility of the [COMPANY CA]’s comprises the
   overall management of the certificate lifecycle including the
   following actions:

-  Issuance

-  Revocation

-  Renewal

-  Status validation

..

   1.7.1.1Role of [COMPANY CA]

   [COMPANY CA] operates as a Trust Service Provider to deliver Trust
   Services to a user community.

Subscribers
-----------

   Subscribers of [COMPANY] services are natural persons that
   successfully apply for a certificate. Subscribers are parties that
   have ultimate authority over the private key corresponding to the
   public key that is listed in a subject certificate.

   Natural persons that are subscribers typically hold a valid
   identification document, which might be used as credential in order
   to issue [COMPANY] certificates.

   Additional credentials are required as explained in the process for
   the application for a certificate.

Relying Parties
---------------

   Relying parties are natural or legal persons that rely on a
   certificate and/or a digital signature verifiable with reference to a
   public key listed in a subscriber’s certificate.

   To verify the validity of a digital certificate, relying parties must
   always refer to [COMPANY CA] revocation information such as a
   Certificate Revocation List (CRL). Certificate validation takes place
   prior to relying on information featured in a certificate. Relying
   parties meet specific obligations as described in this CPS.

Certificate Use
===============

   Certain limitations apply to the use of [COMPANY CA] certificates.

Appropriate Certificate Usage
-----------------------------

   [COMPANY] certificates can be used for public domain transactions
   that require:

-  Authentication and

-  Confidentiality

..

   Additional uses are specifically designated once they become
   available to end entities.

|    This section describes non-technical security controls used  |   |
|    by [COMPANY CA] to perform the functions of key generation,  |   |
|    subject authentication, certificate issuance, certificate    |   |
|    revocation, audit, and archival.                             |   |
|                                                                 |   |
| 1. **Physical Security Controls**                               |   |
|                                                                 |   |

|    The [COMPANY CA] implements physical controls on its own,    |   |
|    leased or rented premises.                                   |   |
|                                                                 |   |
|    The [COMPANY CA] infrastructure is logically separated from  |   |
|    any other certificate management infrastructure, used for    |   |
|    other purposes.                                              |   |
|                                                                 |   |
|    The [COMPANY CA] secure premises are located in an area      |   |
|    appropriate for high-security operations.                    |   |
|                                                                 |   |
|    Physical access is restricted by implementing mechanisms to  |   |
|    control access from one area of the facility to another or   |   |
|    access into high-security zones.                             |   |
|                                                                 |   |
|    The [COMPANY CA] implements prevention and protection as     |   |
|    well as measures against fire exposures.                     |   |
|                                                                 |   |
|    Media are stored securely. Backup media are also stored in a |   |
|    separate location that is physically secure and protected    |   |
|    from fire and water damages.                                 |   |
|                                                                 |   |
|    The sites of the [COMPANY CA] host the infrastructure to     |   |
|    provide the [COMPANY CA] services. The [COMPANY CA] sites    |   |
|    implement proper security controls, including access         |   |
|    control, intrusion detection and monitoring. Access to the   |   |
|    sites is limited to authorized personnel listed on an access |   |
|    list..                                                       |   |
