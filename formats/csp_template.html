<blockquote>
<p>The [COMPANY CA] ensures the availability of all services pertaining to the management of [COMPANY] certificates, including without limitation the issuing, revocation, status verification of a certificate, as they may become available or required in specific applications.</p>
<p>Appropriate publication is necessary to ensure that relying parties obtain notice or knowledge of functions associated with the revoked and/or suspended certificates. Publication is manifested by including a revoked or suspended certificate in a certificate revocation list that is published in an online directory.</p>
<p>The domain of responsibility of the [COMPANY CA]’s comprises the overall management of the certificate lifecycle including the following actions:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Issuance</p>
</li>
<li><p>Revocation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Renewal</p>
</li>
<li><p>Status validation</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Subscribers of [COMPANY] services are natural persons that successfully apply for a certificate. Subscribers are parties that have ultimate authority over the private key corresponding to the public key that is listed in a subject certificate.</p>
<p>Natural persons that are subscribers typically hold a valid identification document, which might be used as credential in order to issue [COMPANY] certificates.</p>
<p>Additional credentials are required as explained in the process for the application for a certificate.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="relying-parties">Relying Parties</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Relying parties are natural or legal persons that rely on a certificate and/or a digital signature verifiable with reference to a public key listed in a subscriber’s certificate.</p>
<p>To verify the validity of a digital certificate, relying parties must always refer to [COMPANY CA] revocation information such as a Certificate Revocation List (CRL). Certificate validation takes place prior to relying on information featured in a certificate. Relying parties meet specific obligations as described in this CPS.</p>
